						Jesus said, in John, chapter three, verse three, <strong><em>"Except a man be born again, he CANNOT see the kingdom of God."</em></strong>
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						He made it clear: we have been born once into this earth of flesh and blood. In order to step from earth into Heaven WE MUST BE BORN AGAIN.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						The second birth Jesus speaks of involves NOT flesh and blood but the real us, our spirit man. Our human spirit, residing deep inside our being, must be born of the Spirit of God.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						We entered this earth alive physically yet dead spiritually. That is why our spirit must be "born again."
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						When our forefather, Adam, transgressed against God, disobeyed Him in the Garden of Eden, he fell into a state of spiritual death immediately, although it took many years for Adam to die physically.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						Therefore, all of Adam's descendants (you ... me) arrive on planet earth separated from God because of Adam's original sin. We sin because of what we ARE: sinners.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						But God made a way out for us ... a Way back in the fellowship with Himself. That Way is His Son, Jesus Christ, Who became flesh (stepping from Heaven to earth), being born of a virgin with the sinless Blood of God in His veins.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						Jesus deliberately went to the Cross and voluntarily sacrificed His own sinless life in exchange for your own. The price for sin must be paid and Jesus' shed Blood was that price. His Blood alone made peace with God for you and for me, washing all our sin away. Hebrews chapter 9, verse 22 tells us, without shedding of blood is no remission (no removal of sin).
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						It is done. Jesus has told us in John 14:6, I am the way the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. We receive eternal life and a home in Heaven only by receiving Jesus.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						At the moment we invite Jesus to come into our heart, accepting Him and all He has done for us, the Holy Spirit imports eternal life to our dead spirit, causing us to be "born again" ... born of the Spirit.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						Would you like to be "born again" ... to enter into joy and life everlasting? If so, pray the following prayer, meaning it in your heart:
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt" style=" text-align: center; color: #b20909;">
						Lord Jesus, I receive You and Your sacrifice for me. Forgive my sins and wash me with Your shed Blood. I invite You into my heart, and I thank You for causing me to be born again ... for giving me Your gift of eternal life. I confess You as my Savior and my Lord and forever commit my life to You. Thank You, Father in Heaven, that I am now Your Child. Teach me to know You and Your Word.<br />In Jesus' Name, Amen.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						(If your prayed the prayer above, you have become a citizen of Heaven. Pray daily to the Father in Jesus' Name. If you will <a href="mailto:info@vaquerosencristo.org">write and tell us</a> that you have received Jesus, we will send you one of our <a href="http://www.rodeocowboyministries.org/contact.php">Rodeo Cowboy Ministries Bibles</a> as well as our newsletter and other helpful literature.)
