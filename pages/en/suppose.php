					<h2>Suppose It Is True, After All?</h2>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						Three cowboys had just left a rodeo and were headed down the road to the next one. The conversation turned to the move of the Lord among cowboys.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						Two of them began to question the reality of it. They finally decided that "religion" was just a crutch - some guys just needed something to hang onto.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						They debated for a couple of hours trying to decide if there really was a heaven and a hell. They finally decided there must be a God, but that a kind and loving God surely wouldn't send anyone to hell. They agreed they both did some pretty rotten things which they hoped God would overlook.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						The third cowboy, a new Christian, finally spoke up. "Suppose it is true, after all, that God must punish sin, and that Jesus Christ took that punishment for us? Suppose the Bible is right when it says that all who die without Jesus Christ go into an eternal hell - and those who die with Him go to Heaven?"
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						"Why, God has made it easy for us. He has made the Way. All we have to do is accept what He has already done."
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						How do you do that -- how do you accept what God has already done?" One of the first cowboys asked sheepishly. His heart told him that his Christian friend spoke the truth.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						The Christian cowboy smiled and said, "It is simple. You just agree with Jesus when He says, <strong><em>'I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me'</em></strong> (John 14:6). You admit you are a sinner for He says, <strong><em>'All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God'</em></strong> (Romans 3:23). You see that Jesus willingly took our sin upon Himself when He died on the cross so that we might become God's children through Him. <strong><em>'He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him'</em></strong> ( II Corinthians 5:21)."
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						The new Christian paused and looked at his two friends who were listening to him intently. "If you'd like, I can lead you in a prayer which will change your entire lives. It's a prayer of introduction to the Lord Jesus Christ - a prayer to receive His free gift of eternal life."
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						The cowboy at the wheel of the pickup put his foot on the brake, slowed the rig, and pulled off to the side of the road. He pulled off his hat and bowed his head. "I'm ready." "Me too." The other cowboy did likewise.
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						"Pray after me," their Christian friend instructed them: <span style=" color: #b20909;">"Lord Jesus, I invite you into my heart and life. I thank you for dying for me. Forgive my sins and be both my Saviour and my Lord. Thank you for giving me a new life in you."</span>
					</p>
					
					<p class="main_txt">
						Reader, YOU can pray the same prayer these cowboys prayed and receive the same free gift of eternal life. Jesus Christ loves YOU. <a href="mailto:info@vaquerosencristo.org">Write and tell us</a> of your commitment to Jesus so that we can pray for you. Also, we will send you one of our <a href="http://www.rodeocowboyministries.org/products.htm" target="_blank">Rodeo Cowboy Ministries Bibles</a> as well as our newsletter and other helpful literature.
